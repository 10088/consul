title: Agent
---

An agent is the long running daemon on every member of the Consul cluster.
It is started by running `consul agent`. The agent is able to run in either _client_
or _server_ mode. Since all nodes must be running an agent, it is simpler to refer to
the node as being either a client or server, but there are other instances of the agent. All
agents can run the DNS or HTTP interfaces, and are responsible for running checks and
keeping services in sync.
