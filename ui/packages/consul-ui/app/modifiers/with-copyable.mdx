# with-copyable

Modifier for adding copy-to-clipboard functionality to any component to allow
the user to easily copy specified text to their clipboard by clicking on
something. Mainly an Ember flavoured wrapper for `window.navigator.clipboard`
along with a polyfill using [Clipboard.js](https://clipboardjs.com/) if native
clipboard access is not available. The ClipboardJS implementation came first,
which is why the innards are this are shaped like ClipboardJS. As a todo, the
innards should be reversed to use the native clipboard interface.

You can either explicitly specify the content to be copied to the users
clipboard using the first (and only) parameter but if this is omitted it will
use the content (`innerText`) of the DOM element it is attached to.

Usually you will want to provide a `success` and `error` callback which you
can provide with named parameters.

Please note: The functionality is specifically modifier shaped to prevent folks trying to copy things on anything other than a click/enter keypress.

```hbs preview-template
<figure>
  <figcaption>Explicitly specifying the text to be copied as the first parameter</figcaption>
  <button
    {{with-copyable "Copied text"
      success=(action (mut this.copied) value="text")
      error=(noop)
    }}
    type="button"
  >Click me</button>

  <pre>Clipboard Contents:
{{this.copied}}</pre>
</figure>
```

```hbs preview-template
<figure>
  <figcaption>Defaulting to the innerText of the DOM element</figcaption>
  <button
    {{with-copyable success=(action (mut this.copied) value="text")}}
    type="button"
  >Click <span><br />me</span></button>

  <pre>Clipboard Contents:
{{this.copied}}</pre>
</figure>
```

During development the modifier automatically logs out what was copied to the
clipboard (or the error if the copying wasn't successful), so you can see what
is happening without having to check your clipboard. The code for this is
removed during a production build.

```sh
with-copyable: Copied `26.140.249.222`
```

The clipboard class is provided via a `clipboard` Service (either native or
polyfill functionality is injected here depending on support). During testing
we also includes a `clipboard/local-storage` Service that automatically
replaces the native based clipboard during testing to enable you to assert for
text that would be copied to the clipboard. During acceptance testing there is
a specific step specifically for this so you don't have to think about it:

```gherkin acceptance-test
Scenario:
  When I click copyButton
  Then I copied "stringToCopy"
```
