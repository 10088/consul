# Installing Consul

Consul-Terraform-Sync is a daemon that runs alongside Consul, similar to other Consul ecosystem tools like Consul Template. Consul-Terraform-Sync is not included with the Consul binary and will need to be installed separately. First, we recommend installing Consul. For simplicity, we are using a local Consul agent in development mode which can be started with consul agent -dev. To quickly set up a local Consul agent, refer to the getting started [guide](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/consul/get-started-install). The Consul agent must be running to dynamically update network devices.

# Installing Consul-Terraform-Sync

To install Consul-Terraform-Sync, find the [appropriate package](https://releases.hashicorp.com/) for your system and download it as a zip archive. Unzip the package to extract the binary named consul-terraform-sync. Move the consul-terraform-sync binary to a location available on your PATH.

```shell-session
$ mv ~/Downloads/consul-terraform-sync /usr/local/bin/consul-terraform-sync
```

You can also install Consul-Terraform-Sync as a [Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/u/hashicorp/consul-terraform-sync) or build the binary from [source](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-terraform-sync).

Once installed, verify the installation works by prompting the help option.

```shell-session
$ consul-terraform-sync -h
