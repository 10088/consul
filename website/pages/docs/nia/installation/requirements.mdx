# Prerequisites Needed to Run Consul-Terraform-Sync

Consul-Terraform-Sync requires a Terraform Provider, a Terraform Module and a running Consul Cluster outside of the consul-terraform-sync daemon. Practitioners can add support for their network infrastructure through Terraform providers. Once network infrastructure support exists, practitioners can add network integrations in the form of Terraform modules.

## Network Infrastructure (using a Terraform Provider)

Consul-Terraform-Sync integrations for the Terraform driver utilizes Terraform providers as plugins to interface with specific network infrastructure platforms. The Terraform driver of Consul-Terraform-Sync inherits the expansive collection of Terraform providers to integrate with, and with release of [Terraform 0.13](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/announcing-hashicorp-terraform-0-13/), this extends to include providers written by the community too ([provider source](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/adding-provider-source-to-hashicorp-terraform/)).

### Finding and Using Terraform Providers

To find providers for the infrastructure platforms you use, browse the providers section of the [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/browse/providers).

### How to Create a Provider

If there is no existing Terraform provider, a new Terraform provider can be [created](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/provider-setup) and [published](https://www.terraform.io/docs/registry/providers/publishing.html). The provider can then be used within a network integration task by authoring a compatible Terraform module.

## Network Integration (using a Terraform Module)

Working with a Terraform provider, you can write an integration task for Consul-Terraform-Sync by creating a Terraform module that is compatible with the Terraform driver.

### Using Terraform Modules

The modules listed below are availabe to use and are comptabible with consul-terraform-sync.

#### A10

#### Checkpoint

#### Cisco ACI

#### F5

#### Palo Alto Networks

### How to Create a Terraform Module

You can read more on how to [create a module](https://www.terraform.io/docs/modules/index.html) or work through a [tutorial to build a module](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/module-create). Consul-Terraform-Sync is designed to integrate with any module that satisfies the specifications in the following section.
